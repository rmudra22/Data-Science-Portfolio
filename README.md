# Ruslana Mudra - Data Science Portfolio
## Introduction
Welcome here! 

I'm Rusya, and I'm learning Data Science with mostly an open source information I can get. Always fascinated by the power of data and the insights it can bring to humanity, I decided to embark on my own journey into it! I graduated from Alfred Nobel University in Dnipro, specializing in International Economic Relations, earning my Bachelor's Degree. I am sharing all the projects I'm working on during my learning process, and we'll see what's next :)

## Portfolio Projects
### Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis in Ukraine (2016 - 2021) (Ongoing)
**Description:** The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis project provides a comprehensive examination of greenhouse gas emissions across various sectors over a five-year period (2016 - 2021). Utilizing a combination of Excel, Python (with Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization), and Power BI, this analysis offers valuable insights into the environmental impact of different economic activities.   
This project contains .csv files with datasets were used, Jupyter Notebook file with a code for a data preprocessing, ReadMe file for a deeper understanding of the compounds' nature, PowerBI visualization file.   
**Path:**  [Project 1 - Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Ukraine (2016 - 2021)](https://github.com/rmudra22/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emissions%20Analysis)    

### Exploratory Notebooks
**Description:** This section is a collection of my learning journey in data science, where I’ve gathered notebooks from different courses and projects. Each one represents a new skill I’ve tackled—whether it’s data cleaning, visualizations, or diving into machine learning basics. Through these exercises, I’ve not only practiced essential techniques but also explored my own ideas and approaches along the way. As I keep learning, I’ll be adding more notebooks with new topics and deeper analyses.
